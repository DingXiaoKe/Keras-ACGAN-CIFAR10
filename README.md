# Keras-ACGAN-CIFAR10
Code Modified from https://github.com/lukedeo/keras-acgan,  
This is CIFAR10 version. Some interesting tricks refers to Soumith Chintala ganhacks(https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks). 
I directly use the Minibatch Layer Code from:  
https://github.com/forcecore/Keras-GAN-Animeface-Character  
Thanks for the great work!   
I am still not satisfied with the generated images yet, Any suggestion is welcomed!
This is one of generate image after 50 epochs:

This is one of generate image after 200 epochs:
